### 1. [Realtime, multimodal invasive ventilation risk monitoring using language models and BoXHED](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03725)
**Summary**: The paper introduces a novel approach to realtime invasive ventilation (iV) risk monitoring in ICUs by integrating clinical notes through language models, enhancing the traditional reliance on tabular data. The proposed method achieves superior performance metrics, including an AUROC of 0.86, and demonstrates increased lead time in flagging iV risks, suggesting significant potential for improving patient care and clinical decision-making.

### 2. [Neurosymbolic AI approach to Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03726)
**Summary**: The paper proposes a Neurosymbolic AI (NesyAI) approach to improve attribution in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues like hallucinations, biases, and unreliable sources by combining neural networks with structured symbolic reasoning. This integration aims to provide more reliable, interpretable, and adaptable systems for ensuring the factual accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs.

### 3. [Progress Report: Towards European LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03730)
**Summary**: The paper presents preliminary results from the OpenGPT-X project, which has developed two multilingual large language models (LLMs) capable of supporting all 24 official European Union languages. These models, trained on a dataset with 60% non-English content and optimized with a custom multilingual tokenizer, show competitive performance on multilingual benchmarks, addressing the limitations of existing LLMs that primarily focus on English.
