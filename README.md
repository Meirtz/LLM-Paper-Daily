### 1. [Title:
          Human Bias in the Face of AI: The Role of Human Judgement in AI Generated Text Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03723)
**Summary**: The study examines how human biases influence perceptions of AI-generated text, finding that even when AI and human-generated texts are indistinguishable, humans prefer content labeled as "Human Generated." This bias persists even when labels are swapped, indicating a broader societal and cognitive undervaluation of AI performance. The research underscores the need to improve human-AI collaboration, particularly in creative domains.

### 2. [Title:
          Realtime, multimodal invasive ventilation risk monitoring using language models and BoXHED](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03725)
**Summary**: The paper introduces a novel approach to real-time invasive ventilation (iV) risk monitoring in ICUs by integrating clinical notes through language models, enhancing the traditional reliance on tabular data. The proposed method achieves superior performance metrics, including an AUROC of 0.86, and demonstrates extended lead time in flagging iV risks, suggesting significant potential for improved patient care and clinical decision-making.

### 3. [Title:
          Neurosymbolic AI approach to Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03726)
**Summary**: The paper addresses the challenges of attribution in large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and reliance on unreliable sources, by proposing the integration of Neurosymbolic AI (NesyAI). NesyAI combines neural networks with structured symbolic reasoning to provide more reliable, interpretable, and adaptable attribution methods, enhancing the factual accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs.
