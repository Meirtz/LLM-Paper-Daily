### 1. [Title:
          Human Bias in the Face of AI: The Role of Human Judgement in AI Generated Text Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03723)
**Summary**: The study examines how human biases influence the perception of AI-generated text, finding that even when AI and human-generated content are indistinguishable, humans prefer content labeled as "Human Generated." This bias persists even when labels are swapped, highlighting the need to address these cognitive biases to improve human-AI collaboration, particularly in creative domains.

### 2. [Title:
          Realtime, multimodal invasive ventilation risk monitoring using language models and BoXHED](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03725)
**Summary**: The paper introduces a novel approach to real-time invasive ventilation (iV) risk monitoring in intensive care units (ICUs) by integrating clinical notes through language models, enhancing the traditional reliance on tabular data. The proposed method achieves superior performance metrics, including an AUROC of 0.86, AUC-PR of 0.35, and AUCt up to 0.86, demonstrating improved lead time in flagging iV risks. This integration of clinical notes and language

### 3. [Title:
          Neurosymbolic AI approach to Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03726)
**Summary**: The paper proposes a Neurosymbolic AI (NesyAI) approach to improve attribution in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues like hallucinations, biases, and unreliable sources. By combining neural networks with structured symbolic reasoning, NesyAI aims to provide more transparent, interpretable, and reliable attribution methods, enhancing the factual accuracy and adaptability of LLM outputs.
