### 1. [Title:
          Revisiting the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03717)
**Summary**: The paper challenges the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis by demonstrating that post-training with increasing fine-tuning examples significantly improves language model performance across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and multihop reasoning. The study reveals that model performance scales as a power law with the number of fine-tuning examples, indicating that post-training is crucial for enhancing reasoning abilities and integrating new knowledge, contrary to the hypothesis's claims.

### 2. [Title:
          Performance Evaluation of Tokenizers in Large Language Models for the Assamese Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03718)
**Summary**: The paper evaluates the performance of tokenizers in five state-of-the-art large language models for the Assamese language, highlighting the importance of tokenizer training in deep learning models. The study finds that the SUTRA tokenizer from Two AI performs the best with an average Normalized Sequence Length (NSL) of 0.45, followed by GPT-4o from Open AI with an NSL of 0.54, while the other models, Gemma

### 3. [Title:
          Thematic Analysis with Open-Source Generative AI and Machine Learning: A New Method for Inductive Qualitative Codebook Development](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03721)
**Summary**: The paper introduces the Generative AI-enabled Theme Organization and Structuring (GATOS) workflow, which utilizes open-source generative text models and machine learning techniques to facilitate thematic analysis in social science research. Through three case studies, the authors demonstrate that the GATOS workflow can effectively inductively create codebooks similar to traditional thematic analysis methods, highlighting its potential as a new approach for qualitative research.
