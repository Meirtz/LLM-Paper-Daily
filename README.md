### 1. [Title:
          FaithEval: Can Your Language Model Stay Faithful to Context, Even If "The Moon is Made of Marshmallows"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03727)
**Summary**: The paper introduces FaithEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the faithfulness of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in handling unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. The benchmark includes 4.9K high-quality problems and reveals that even advanced models frequently struggle to maintain faithfulness to the given context, highlighting the ongoing challenges in ensuring reliable model performance.

### 2. [Title:
          Progress Report: Towards European LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03730)
**Summary**: The paper presents preliminary results from the OpenGPT-X project, which has developed two multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) to support all 24 official European Union languages. These models, trained on a dataset with 60% non-English content and optimized with a custom multilingual tokenizer, aim to overcome the limitations of existing LLMs that primarily focus on English. The models show competitive performance on multilingual benchmarks, including European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU,

### 3. [Title:
          Unsupervised Human Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03731)
**Summary**: The paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised human preference learning by using small parameter models as preference agents to generate natural language rules that guide a larger pre-trained model, enabling efficient personalization without fine-tuning the large model. Experimental results show significant improvement over baseline methods, suggesting a promising approach for personalized language model applications.
